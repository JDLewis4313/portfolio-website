That my friend is the most important part, to begin.  Like many of you who may be reading this, I found it difficult to pick a language, ultimately I picked Python and committed to learning a stack. That's it, Python, and a stack involving it. Now mind you, I already had some extensive experience with HTML and CSS with and a dose of JavaScript. The common web development stack, but I wanted to gain frontend and backend experience. Thus, why I had to choose between Python, Java, C, #C. Whew. You get the picture, but why did I choose Python? As many of you will hear, it's syntax is relatively easy to master, being so closely related to English. But to be honest, it's popularity got me to. It's easy to find courses and do projects with Python and the IDEs, so many great options including VS Studio. So, how did I get to my stack? Let me explain!",
